# SOEN343 Project

Project for Soen 342 Team Rocket Fall 2022

## Objective

The objective of this project is to develop a community service platform with a variety of features.

## Project Description

This project will consist of developping an online platform which would serve as a central community service/hub where people would be able to find other people to do sports with as well as to participate in sporting events or take private classses. Players of all sporting backgrounds will use the platform to form teams, find players, set games, find fields and even find teachers for the sport they want to learn. Thoruhg the platform, members would also be able to organize and participate in locally run tournaments which will be run by volunteers. These volunteers from various backgrounds will submit an applicatinon for various positions. Finally, the platform is particualarly useful because it will allow people to communicate with each other, unlike other platform with similar feautres. Hence, this universal sporting platform will not only help people who already play sports, but also engage people within the community who are completely new to it, or simply want to volunteer.
